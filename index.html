<h3> Clay (born August 12, 1999), known online as Dream, is an American YouTuber and Twitch streamer who is known primarily for creating Minecraft content.

Dream has been active online since 2014,[2] but did not gain substantial popularity until 2019 and 2020. He is well known for his YouTube series "Minecraft Manhunt" and was also well known for his Minecraft speedruns, in which he was accused of cheating in late 2020. Dream later admitted to using game modifications, but maintained that he used them unintentionally during his single-player speedruns, intending for them to only apply during his multiplayer "challenge videos".[3][4] Content created in the Dream SMP, Dream's invite-only survival multiplayer (SMP) Minecraft server that stars content creators engaged in roleplay, has also attracted considerable attention and a popular fandom.

As of September 10, 2022, his seven YouTube channels have collectively reached over 41.96 million subscribers[a] and over 3.29 billion views,[b] and his two Twitch channels have collectively gained 7.01 million followers[c] and 19.01 million views.[d] YouTube awarded Dream the Streamy Award for Gaming in both 2020 and 2021.</h3>
